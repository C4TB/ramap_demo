# RA-Map demo setup

This repository contains the configuration and additional files that are used to power the [demonstration portal](http://rhenkin.shinyapps.io/ramap_demo) for the [shinyExprPortal](https://github.com/C4TB/shinyExprPortal) package.

If you want to set up your own portal and want to check examples, the following files are useful:

- config.yaml
- models.tsv
- modules_table.tsv

Please note that this repostiory does not contain the data files. The data files in the portal were obtained from GEO as part of series [GSE97476](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97476). A subset of the data was created to load into the portal.
